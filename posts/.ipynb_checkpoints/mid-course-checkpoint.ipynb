For implementation, I have completed the perceptron, gradient decent and linear regression blog posts, each of which involved implementing a different machine learning algorithm. I have also persued experimentation through testing my implementation of these different algorithms, along with completing the penguin blog post in which I experimented with different algorithms to perform penguin classification. I plan to persue experimentation more through my final project as well."

To do this, I have spent many hours attending peer help and office hours to help me overcome obstacles I was facing with each blog post. Another goal I had was to turn in each blog post within 5 days of the recommended due date. I am also on track to complete this goal, as up to this point each blog post has been turned in with in 5 days of the recommended due date. Another goal I am on track to meet is revising three of my blog posts to the no suggestions level. So far, I am working on revising my perceptron blog post to that status, and as I recieve more feedback I will work on others as well. There are no goals that I set for my blog post that I am not on track to meet."

I am on track to meet this goal, as I haven't had to pass on presenting although I did have to ask for help one time while I was presenting. Another goal I set was to frequently attend office hours and peer help sessions when needed. I have been able to do a fairly good job completing this goal, however because of my sports schedule some of the times are difficult for me to make. Because of this, I have put the slack channel to good use by asking a lot of questions. One goal that I was unsucessful in is finding a group of people to work with. There have been times at office hours or peer help sessions where I may ask a classmate a question, however I never found a set group to regularily work on assignments with. "
