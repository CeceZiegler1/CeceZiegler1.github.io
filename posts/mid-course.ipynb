For implementation, I have completed the perceptron, gradient decent and linear regression blog posts, each of which involved implementing a different machine learning algorithm. I have also persued experimentation through testing my implementation of these different algorithms, along with completing the penguin blog post in which I experimented with different algorithms to perform penguin classification. I plan to persue experimentation more through my final project as well."

My work load has picked up in other classes, and I want to put full effort into my final project. With that being said, I will still attempt most blog posts, I am just not sure it is reasonable for me to say I am going to complete all of them. To complete the blog posts up to this point, I have spent many hours attending peer help and office hours to help me overcome obstacles I was facing with each blog post. Another goal I had was to turn in each blog post I complete within 5 days of the recommended due date. I am also on track to complete this goal, as up to this point each blog post has been turned in with in 5 days of the recommended due date. Another goal I am on track to meet is revising three of my blog posts to the no suggestions level. So far, I am working on revising my perceptron blog post to that status, and the feedback I have recieved on my other two blog posts are already at the no suggestions level."

Another goal I had was to complete all of the warm up activites so I never have to pass on presenting. I am on track to meet this goal, as I haven't had to pass on presenting although I did have to ask for help one time while I was presenting. Another goal I set was to frequently attend office hours and peer help sessions when needed. I have been able to do a fairly good job completing this goal, however because of my sports schedule some of the times are difficult for me to make. Because of this, I have put the slack channel to good use by asking a lot of questions. One goal that I was unsucessful in is finding a group of people to work with. There have been times at office hours or peer help sessions where I may ask a classmate a question, however I never found a set group to regularily work on assignments with. "

We haven't worked in groups yet, but as the project proposal is approaching and other project deadlines will be coming up, I want to make sure I am on top of my part of the project and not letting my group members down.

Another aspect of the course I really enjoyed that I didn't set as a goal in my initial blog post was the section on bias and fairness within machine learning algorithms. It is a little bit scary to think how these programs we are making can have such an adverse impact on the world if we aren't careful with the way we create the algorithms or the data we feed them. I am looking forward to the talk with our guest speaker to learn more about these issues and concerns."
